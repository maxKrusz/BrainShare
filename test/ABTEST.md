## A/B Test #2

### A/B Test Name: 
Logo Change
### User Story Number: 
8
### Metric (from the HEART grid): 
Download Rate, Sign Up rate
### Hypothesis: 
By changing our logo, we will be able to increase the adoption rate of our app. This is because the logo is the first thing that users see when going to open the app, as well as represents the application itself, so it must be both appealing to the user and representative of the app itself. Therefore, by changing our logo/color scheme to be more appealing to the user, we will be able to increase the adoption rate of our app.
### Experiment - 
We will use Firebase Remote Config to publish several different app versions, with each variation having a different logo/color scheme. This experiment will be run for one month, in which all app downloads will receive a different logo/color scheme for the application. Then, we will collect analytics regarding the app download rate and sign up rate to determine which logo/color scheme is the most effective.
### Variations -
