# BrainShare Business Plan
For the BrainShare application, we are using the Lean Canvas approach to model our business plan. Within this approach, we had to develop a one-page business plan that allowed us to answer all of the important questions to consider when developing a business idea. The Lean Canvas model has 9 major sections, being Customer Segments, Channels, Advantage, Unique Value Proposition, Solution, Key Metrics, Problem, Cost Structure, and Revenue Streams. By following this model, we had to think about all of these various areas of our application, refining our idea to better suit the needs of our customers.
