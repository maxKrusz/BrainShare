# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## 1. Our Pledge
    We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
    community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
    size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
    identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
    nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
    identity and orientation.

    We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
    diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## 2. Our Standards
    Being courteous and proactive... Just have common sense etiquette towards your team mates
    Be kind and helpful...
    Don't say ignorant/bigotted comments... 
    Own up to mistakes...
    Don't shame each other for mistakes...
    Let's encourage a good communicative project group!

### 3. Decisions
    We will make decisions based on Majority Consensus, in the context of a tie in decision, 
    we will create a middle ground compromise, and decide if the compromise is worth it. 
    
### 4. Attendance
    We expect everyone to participate and communicate in the event of not making a meeting. 
    As long as you have a legitimate reason, and seek to catch up with the rest of the team, you are fine.
    Valid excuses for missing attendance:
      Family/private situations...
      Medical issues...
      Job/Mandatory responsibilities...
      Any other emergencies...
     In the event of missing a meeting, groupmates are expected to report to the Discord channel and 
     try to catch up on information covered in the meetings.
    
### 5. Assignments
    First come first serve, give highest preference and lowest preference on list of tasks, 
    and SCRUM master will make final decision if there are conflicts.
    
    In the event that a team member is consistently not finishing their tasks, they will be put under probation, 
    and expected to give regular updates on their progress to the team.
    
    If this continues, it will be left to the SCRUM master's discretion on what to do.

### 6. Participation
    We will communicate via Discord and email, for the first phase of the project we will pool information on Discord. 
    We will ensure participation by clearly mandating tasks to each team member, and give a soft deadline for each task. 
    In the event a extension is needed, we expect that teammate to give a 36-24 hour notice beforehand. 
    We seek to honor strengths and weaknesses, by giving team members the choice to choose what they want to work on, 
    have team feedback and try to understand what each member is good at.

### 7. Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums
    Virtual meetings on Discord, and after lab meetings if necessary, on URI campus.
    
### 8. Agenda and Minutes/Notes
    Scrum Master is responsible for team agenda notes, but individual team member are expected 
    to give some level of feedback notes on specific tasks if asked.

### 9. Promptness
    We will handle lateness, by reaching out to the teammate and catching them up. We expect the teammate that missed the meeting/is late 
    to pick up their own slack, and communicate with the rest of the team.
    We will not penalize unless there is no contribution/consistent bad behavior. We won't make it a problem unless theres a pattern of bad behavior.
    We will penalize based on Scrum Master's discretion.

### 10. Conversational Courtesies
    We trust that everyone is intelligent and mature, so no hand holding in conversations. 
    We want honest and constructive feedback, as well as an environment where everyone is helping each other, 
    as long as we are all being respectful, and on topic, we aren't going to enforce strict rules on conversational courtesies.
    But that being said there will be no:
    Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Discrimination of any kind...

### 11. Enforcement/ Feedback
    We operate purely on a morality based code, it is up to you to be the best person you can. 
    Punishment will be delegated by SCRUM Master, and the lost of faith from the rest of your team mates.
